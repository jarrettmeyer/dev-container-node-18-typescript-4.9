# VS Code Dev Containers: Node 18 + TypeScript 4.9

## Requirements

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## VS Code Extensions

- [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
- [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Opening a project

When you open a project (like this one!) that uses Dev Containers you might see a pop-up like this one:

![pop-up: reopen in Dev Containers](./docs/images/popup-reopen-in-dev-containers.png)

If you do not see this pop-up, you may not have the Dev Containers extension installed. You can still reopen the project with the command palette.
